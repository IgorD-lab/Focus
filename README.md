## Project Status: Abandoned - Planned Remake in Django + React

**Current Status and Future Plans**  

This project is currently in maintenance mode and won't receive active development updates. However, exciting plans are in the works! We're envisioning a remake using a powerful and scalable tech stack: Django for the backend and React for the frontend.

**Open-source Invitation**  

Feel free to use any part of the existing codebase for your own projects. We understand there might be some exploratory or experimental code as this project was primarily a learning experience. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!

**Reasons for Abandonment:**

* **Improved Development Efficiency:** Django's streamlined approach and built-in functionalities significantly increase development speed, allowing focus on core features and logic rather than boilerplate code.
* **Enhanced Code Maintainability:** Django's structure and organization promote writing clean and maintainable code, beneficial for future project scaling and complexity. Also Current code is all over the place with bootstrap tailwindcss and regular css making it very hard to change and/or read.
* **Better User Experience Potential:** Django provides a solid foundation for building user-friendly interfaces with features like authentication, authorization, and forms handling, leading to a more positive user experience.

**Planned Remake:**

The planned remake will leverage the following technologies:

* **Django:** A high-level Python web framework known for its clean syntax, rapid development, and excellent security features.
* **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and user-friendly user interfaces.

This combination is expected to provide several benefits:

* **Improved Performance and Scalability:** Django's robust architecture and React's efficient virtual DOM will enhance the project's ability to handle larger user bases and complex interactions.
* **Enhanced Maintainability and Reusability:** Django's well-defined structure and React's component-based approach will make the codebase easier to maintain and extend in the future.
* **Modern Development Experience:** Django and React offer a wide range of tools and libraries that streamline the development process, making it faster and more enjoyable.

**Stay Tuned:**

I am actively working on the remake and will provide updates on its progress through this repository. If you're interested in contributing to the new version, feel free to watch this repository for future announcements.

***> Different Wallpaper options***   
<p>(I never got around to implementing the user ability to change thease but there are many more wallpaper options inside static/images/wallpaper)</p>
